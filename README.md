## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** (we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- **pnpm** (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- **PostgreSQL** database (e.g., [Neon](https://neon.tech), [Supabase](https://supabase.com), or local)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gudlab/guddesk-core.git
cd guddesk-core
pnpm install
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in the required variables:

```env
# Required
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-here"           # Run: openssl rand -base64 32
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
RESEND_API_KEY="re_..."
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="..."
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="..."

# Optional — Real-time messaging
PUSHER_APP_ID="..."
PUSHER_SECRET="..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY="..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER="..."

# Optional — AI features (reply suggestions, summaries, etc.)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Optional — Slack integration
SLACK_CLIENT_ID="..."
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
```

### 3. Set up the database

```bash
pnpm prisma generate
pnpm prisma db push
```

### 4. Build the chat widget

```bash
pnpm run build:widget
```

### 5. Start the dev server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — create an account, set up your first workspace, and embed the chat widget on your site.

### Widget Installation

Add this snippet to your website, just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script>
  window.gudDeskSettings = { appId: "YOUR_APP_ID" };
</script>
<script src="https://your-domain.com/widget.js" async></script>
```

Replace `YOUR_APP_ID` with the App ID from your workspace settings, and `your-domain.com` with your GudDesk deployment URL.

## AI Features

GudDesk integrates with Anthropic's Claude to provide:

- **Reply Suggestions** — AI-generated response drafts based on conversation context
- **Conversation Summaries** — One-click summaries for long conversations
- **Auto-Categorization** — Automatically tag conversations by topic
- **Sentiment Analysis** — Detect customer frustration or satisfaction
- **Article Suggestions** — Recommend relevant knowledge base articles

To enable AI features, set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. All AI features work with your own API key — no additional charges from GudDesk.

## AI Agent Plugins

GudDesk supports external AI agents that connect via the REST API:

1. **Listen** to webhook events (new message, conversation created, tag added, etc.)
2. **Read** conversation history and knowledge base articles via the API
3. **Respond** by sending messages as the `BOT` message type
4. **Take actions** — assign conversations, add tags, change status

Bot messages appear natively in both the chat widget and the agent inbox. Build agents in any language — Python, TypeScript, Go — using GudDesk's REST API.

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your repo to GitHub
2. Import into [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Set environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy — Vercel handles the build automatically

### Docker (Coming Soon)

Docker Compose support for self-hosted deployments is in development.

### Manual

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm start
```
